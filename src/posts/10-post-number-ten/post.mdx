### After all this time...
**Mental Geek has finally returned!** For some of you, this might be your first time with us, so please allow me to tell you all about Mental Geek.

### What is Mental Geek?

Mental Geek was started by me (Matthew Bert) in early 2019. I was going through a rough battle with my depression/anxiety, and I was seeking out some online groups and resources I could connect with, but I found that to be quite difficult.

What I found was most resources, especially on social media, seem to be geared toward women, or others geared toward one specific group in general. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but for me, I left lost and alone.

It was during this time that I decided to start my own sort of community, but one that would be welcoming to all, regardless of gender, race, background, etc. I quickly realized that the geek community is made up of all sorts of people, and we could use a positive avenue to connect and share our mental health stories.

### Soon after realizing what type of community I wanted, Mental Geek was born!

**I came up with a name pretty quick, but I needed to come up with a vision. Here is that vision:**


> Mental Geek is a community for Geeks from all walks of life, where we can share blog posts about our Mental Health struggles, the Geek related things that are important in our lives and journey, and to connect with other geeks from all over. - Regardless if you are a geek over comics, video games, anime, movies, music, your hobbies, fitness, writing, etc...this is for you! You don't have to go through your journey alone. You are welcome here.


With that vision, I quickly created a website. With that website, I would share stories from myself and other geeks. Topics ranged from depression, anxiety, bi-polar, body image, and more. The common theme in these stories is not only what we have learned to grow in our journey, but the geek side of things as well. Every story had a connection with a hobby, interest, etc. One in particular was even about how Star Wars saved someones life (that story will be shared again!). 

Aside from the Blog, I also would post quotes/posts on social media that I found to be encouraging or relatable with mental health topics. 

### There was even a podcast!

Yes, you can still find all 10 episodes on most streaming apps. The first 4-5 are NSFW, but after that we decided to make it PG-13 so more listeners would feel comfortable listening.

### What happened to Mental Geek?

To be honest, I had too many ideas that I was trying to pursue all at once. On top of this, I had a lot of stuff going on for me personally, and I started to experience some major burnout. Not because of Mental Geek, but life in general.

So I took a pause. What I thought would be a month or two has lead into almost a year of being inactive. This was mostly on purpose. I needed to sort my own issues out. THe last thing I needed was for my mental health resource to be a burdon upon my mental health.

### What brought me back?

Well, I always wanted to bring it back. Once the pandemic started this year, and the US went into lockdown mode, I started sharing some posts again on a personal blog. I needed it, and I know others did. It has certainly been a rough year for most of us, and making Mental Health a priority needs to be my priority.

It wasn't until recently that I got back into Web Development (not design, but applications, databases, etc), and it is something I am now pursuing as a career. I wanted to make my journey in this based on Mental Health. I want to create projects that are meaningful and helpful to others. 

So, I quickly realized it was time to bring back Mental Geek.

#### but I needed a clear vision and plan

I could not bring it back and just throw dozens of ideas around and hope they all land.   


### So my plan now is as follows:


1. I am bringing back the blog, which you are on now. I want to get back into the simplicity of sharing not only community stories, but important articles and resources from around the web. I Want it to be more interactive, but not just for the sake of having more website traffic, but for it to actually be of use to others who need it.

2. I am working on making a full blown social website. This is a big idea, and it is still being built, and will still take a few months to complete. - This social app will become the main Mental Geek site. It will still have the main blog posts and resources for anyone, but you will be able to sign up for an account.

The account will allow you to set up a typical social type of profile, and you will be able to write your own little thoughts/blog posts, and they can remain private, or public for others to see. You can connect and chat with other users as well.

The purpose for that vision is to try to have a safe place where people can gather and connect, away from the negativity and distractions from the typical social media sites. It will be simple, yet engaging. 

3. I am going to bring the podcast back at some point. It's easy to record and chat and throw an episode up for listeners, but it's a lot of work to create good content. I want to spend more time on individual episodes, where it's a bit more organized as far as interviewing our guests goes. I also want to have more guests with stories that can connect with more viewers, which means getting into topics we never approached before.
